Title,Introduction,Initial Variable,Initial Variable Direction,KeyIncrease Venous Resistance (Rv) to 200% of Normal,In this experiment we will increase venous resistance (Rv) to 200% of its normal value in a new subject.  This is accomplished  by constricting the small veins just distal to the capillaries. Only Rv is increased by this procedure.  Neither venous compliance or capacitance is affected.,1,1,"0,1,1,0,1,0,1,2,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,2,1"
