This might be accomplished pharmacologically with a drug that causes arteriolar dilatation.",5,1,placeholder text for initial variable summary,"The smooth muscle in the walls of systemic arterioles contain alpha adrenergic receptors that are physiologically stimulated by sympathetic activity.  An adrenergic blocking agent will therefore reduce this input to the arterioles, resulting in vasodilatation and decreased resistance.  Hence, Ra is decreased.The fall is Ra must lead to a fall in MAP (which = CO x TPR).   This fall in MAP reduces the stimulation of the carotid and aortic baroreceptors and hence reduced firing delivered to the CV centers in the medulla.  The consequence is increased sympathetic firing and reduced parasympathetic firing to the heart and blood vessels.  There is therefore an increase in IS and HR.  Ra also increases as long as the dose of the alpha blocker was such that not all alpha receptors were occupied.Increased HR causes CO to increase.  The increase in CO brings about a decrease in CVP as more blood is translocated from the veins to the arteries.  With preload reduced there will be a reduction in SV.  The increased IS that occurs partially counteracts the effect of the reduced preload and the magnitude of the fall in SV is reduced.  With CO increased and Ra increased there is an increase in MAP; the RR response has countered the DR fall in MAP.In the final steady-state (SS) MAP is still reduced as the baroreceptor reflex cannot fully compensate for the initial fall in pressure.  That is to say, the decrease in Ra is greater than the reflex induced increase in CO.","0,1,2,0,2,1,1,2,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1,1"
