Title,Introduction,Initial Variable,Initial Variable Direction,Initial Variable Summary,Procedure Summary,KeyDecrease cardiac inotropic state (IS) to 50% of normal.,In this procedure the inotropic state (IS) is decreased to 50% of normal.  This night occur as the result of a myocardial infarct that destroys an appreciable part of the wall of the left ventricle.,0,1,"An infarct is an ischemic event.  When it occurs in the ventricle it results in the death of myocardial cells.  If the affected ventricle fills to the normal extend (if preload stays the same) the damaged ventricle will generate a reduced output.  Thus, we can say that the inotropic state  of the heart has been decreased.  Thus, IS is the primary variable and its dorection is down.","A myocardial infarct (MI) damages or destroys cardiac muscle cells.  Thus when the ventricle contracts it can only generate a reduced output (however you measure it) with the same preload or filling.  This is equivalent to the heart having a reduced inotropic state (IS).With IS reduced SV volume (one measure of ventricular output) is reduced.  Since HR has not changed (in the DR phase) the cardiac output (CO) must be down.  Since Ra is unchanged in DR and CO is down, there must be a fall in MAP.This generates the stereotypical reflex response (RR).  Increased sympathetic firing causes HR and Ra to increase.  IS also increases in the remaining myocardial cells.  CO is increased by the increased HR.  CVP decreases because of the increased CO.  SV falls as preload falls.  With CO and Ra increased, the baroreceptor reflex results in an increase in MAP.When a new steady state (SS) is achieved, HR and Ra are increased, CO is reduced (the reflex driven increase isnt as large as the initial fall in CO), and CVP is increased.  MAP is still decreased, although not as much as initially (partial compensation has occurred).","1,2,1,0,1,0,1,2,1,1,2,2,2,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1"
