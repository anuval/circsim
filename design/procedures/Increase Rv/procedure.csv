This is accomplished  by constricting the small veins just distal to the capillaries. Only Rv is increased by this procedure.  Neither venous compliance or capacitance is affected.,1,1,"Here, an increase in venous resistance implies a change in central venous pressure.","In this procedure we increased Rv between the end of the capillaries and the great veins around the heart WITHOUT changing venous compliance or capacitance.  This has the effect of dropping the pressure downstream from the increased resistance, the central venous pressure (CVP).  We can also say that the increased venous resistance reduced venous return without affecting cardiac output.  The result is reduced central volume and hence reduced CVP.With CVP reduced there will be reduced SV and hence reduced CO.  MAP must therefore fall.The baroreceptor reflex then generates a response (RR) that will cause MAP to increase.  It does this my increasing IS, HR, and Ra.  CO is thus increased and MAP goes up.In the final steady state (SS) MAP is still reduced as the reflex does not fully compensate for the initial (DR) fall.  All of the neutrally controlled variables are increased and CO is therefore increased.","0,1,1,0,1,0,1,2,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,2,1"
