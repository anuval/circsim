Implemented an autobuild script. Theoretically, I shouldn't need to ever use the gh-pages branch again.  

Work in whatever feature branch I'm on.
Test locally.
When it's working, merge into master.
Commit and push master to github.
Run $ ruby build.rb and it will automatically build the project and push it to gh-pages site.
